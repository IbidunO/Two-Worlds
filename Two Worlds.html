&lt;h1 style=&quot;color:lightblue;&quot;&gt;Two Worlds&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
You wake up in your room. Sunshine comes into your room. You yawn as you sit up and get out of your bed. You can&#39;t wait to get the morning started.
As you are standing up straight, you have two options. You will either brush your teeth, or put on your clothes. Which one will you do? [[Brush your teeth]] or [[Put on clothes]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Brush your teeth" tags="" position="404,145" size="100,100">You&#39;re going to brush your teeth. You come in to the bathroom. Your bathroom has no mirror, but a toilet, sink, and bathtub. You pick up your toothbrush which is at the edge of the sink. You look at it. It is [[Pink with white stars]] or [[Blue with red stars]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Put on clothes" tags="" position="734,194" size="100,100">You decide to put on your clothes. You open your closet. It is full of [[Bright clothes]] or [[Earth-tone clothes]] or [[Dark clothes]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Pink with white stars" tags="" position="253,231" size="100,100">Your toothbrush is pink with white stars. You look at the toothbrush and admire its color, which is your favorite. You look and pick up the toothpaste. The toothpaste is [[Peppermint flavored]] or [[Spearmint flavored]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Blue with red stars" tags="" position="143,231" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Peppermint flavored" tags="" position="363,25" size="100,100">The toothpaste is peppermint flavored. You suddenly can&#39;t wait to put it in your mouth since it reminds you of the mouth-watering candy. You put the paste on your toothbrush and started brushing. As you brush, you imagine the peppermint melting in your mouth.
When you are done, you spit the paste out and turned on the faucet. You rinse your toothbrush and your mouth as well. You set the toothbrush down and turned off the faucet.
Now you need to put mouthwash. You picked up the mouthwash which is at the front edge of the sink. The mouthwash is [[Bubblegum flavored]] or [[Blueberry flavored]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Spearmint flavored" tags="" position="330,306" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Blueberry flavored" tags="" position="757,549" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Bubblegum flavored" tags="" position="565,369" size="100,100">The mouthwash is bubblegum flavored. Since you love bubblegum and chew it everyday, how about buying a bubblegum flavored mouthwash. You took off the cap and poured the mouthwash in your mouth. You swish the wash around your mouth, tasting the flavor of bubblegum. You set the mouthwash bottle down and leaned over, spitting out the mouthwash into the sink. The flavor still lingered in your mouth.
Now that you&#39;re done using the bathroom, you walk out deciding to put on your clothes after you go to your vanity.
You went over to your vanity. Your vanity is [[Pink with LED lights on the top]] or [[Wooden with fresh wood at the edges]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Pink with LED lights on the top" tags="" position="798,303" size="100,100">Your vanity is pink with LED lights at the top. You look at the top of your vanity to see the LED lights,  but they are not turned on. You walk beside your vanity and saw that the plug isn&#39;t in. You bent down and plugged it in, activating the LED lights. The lights brightened up the room even though sunlight lit it up.
You walk to your vanity and sat down. You need to fix up your dreary face. As you look in the mirror, you see a [[Young man]] or [[Young woman]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="Wooden with fresh wood at the edges" tags="" position="616,525" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Young man" tags="" position="639,65" size="100,100">You see a young man in the mirror. You suddenly felt embarrassed to be sitting on a pink vanity with LED lights at the top. Obviously, this is for young girls but you wouldn&#39;t care. You can&#39;t stop loving pink.
As you look into the mirror, you have [[Dark hair]] or [[Light hair]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Young woman" tags="" position="980,17" size="100,100">You see a young woman in the mirror. You are loving the pink vanity with LED lights, even though it is for younger girls. You suddenly wished you were a little girl because the vanity is a little to small.

You looked again and noticed it looked cute on you. Dark spots covered part of your face. It reminded you that when you were a kid, your friends made fun of your freckles while some complimented them. After that, you didn&#39;t know what to think.
After much examination, you realized that you [[Need to fix your face]] or [[Didn&#39;t need to fix your face]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="Bushy Eyebrows" tags="" position="1223,513" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="Rosy cheeks" tags="" position="1200,634" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="Piercing" tags="" position="1454,544" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="No detail" tags="" position="1353,582" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="Need to fix your face" tags="" position="992,549" size="100,100">You needed to fix your face. It was too dreary from that rough sleep last night. You felt the skin on your face and picked up the cream on the vanity.
You put some on your hand and rubbed it together between your hands. You put it all over your face.
Once you are done, you looked in the mirror one last time. There is much to do to get ready for the day.
While you look in the mirror, you saw that the mirror looked weird. It wasn&#39;t just your appearance but the actual mirror itself. You saw that it affected your reflection in some way, but you couldn&#39;t put it out.
Maybe it caused you to think that your face isn&#39;t beautiful. Maybe it did. Then you suddenly noticed a spot on the mirror, looking like there is a spot on your face. You leaned over to wipe it off.
Suddenly, as you touched the spot, your finger went through. You put your finger back quickly. You didn&#39;t know what just happened until you put your finger through it again.
Your finger just went through the actual mirror. You suddenly put your finger back.
Were you crazy? Did this actual thing just happened?
You didn&#39;t know what to do until you put your finger through it again, then your whole hand.
Your hand was warm through the mirror. Did you just discover some secret passageway?, maybe a portal to another dimension?
You put your hand back again. The mirror is still visible. You decided to put [[Your head]] or [[Your leg]] in there.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="27" name="Didn&#39;t need to fix your face" tags="" position="894,699" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="28" name="Your head" tags="" position="1052,665" size="100,100">You attempted to put your head in there. You suddenly got scared. Maybe it was a portal to another dimension and it will look scary, but you have your leg. You will step back when you see something unpleasant.
You finally got the courage and put your head through while your eyes are closed.
While your head was through, you suddenly heard birds chirping. You opened your eyes and saw a completely new land. The sky was blue and there were flowers everywhere. There were birds flying up and down to view the flowers.
Is this Wonderland? or Oz?
You put your head back in. Now that there is nothing to be afraid of, you attempted to go through and explore the land. You stepped back and ran towards the mirror.
You jumped in and found yourself on the ground. You are sitting on the flowers. You got up and looked back at the mirror, which is not really a mirror anymore.
You looked around and saw that this was a whole new world. The trees looked completely foreign to you. You looked past the portal and saw that there was more land. Back there was just some more flowers and trees.
You tried looking for the sun, and it was high up in the sky, shining happily. The birds were chirping up in the sky and flying fast.
You couldn&#39;t believe this was happening. You couldn&#39;t believe this was real. You suddenly felt the need to explore the whole place.
Where do you even begin? There is a variety of flowers and trees all around. As you look at the front of you, there seems to be a path between the trees. The opening was very clear. You come closer and come out of the flowers.
You see that there is a dirt path leading to somewhere. You walk through it to see where it leads to.
As you were walking through the path, the trees were centering you in a straight line. They were big and thick with many leaves. You felt tiny while looking at them.
As you walked on the path, you see two more paths up ahead. They were split by a piece of land with trees on it. You were torn on which path to take. Going on your gut instict, you will take the [[Left Path]] or the [[Right Path]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="29" name="Your leg" tags="" position="877,566" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="Left Path" tags="" position="780,909" size="100,100">You took the left path. As you walk through the left path, you hear something moving to the right of you. As you look, the trees and bushes are moving along with it.
As you are looking, the thing came into view and got out of the bushes. It stepped out in front of you, blocking your path.
The thing was yellow with big blue eyes, wearing overalls and brown loafers. It looked like a troll.
You were fascinated by its look, never imagining a thing like that could exist. The troll had its arms folded.
&quot;Who are you, human?&quot; the troll asked. You started to speak your name.
&quot;Okay [(your name)]. How did you get here?&quot; the troll asked. You didn&#39;t say anything.
&quot;Speak now before I get you out!&quot; the troll yelled as he got into a fighting position.
[[&quot;I got through a portal.&quot;]] or [[&quot;My mirror in my room transported me here.&quot;]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="Right Path" tags="" position="630,889" size="100,100">You walked to the right path. As you walk, you see a house up ahead. The house had white bricks with a red roof. There was a chimney with smoke coming out of it.
The house looked to be comfortable and someone might be welcoming in there. You decided to investigate.
As you walked up to the house, you knocked on the door. For a few moments, you waited, but no one answered.
You were about to knock again until you heard lady crying. It came from the inside of the house.
You said, [[&quot;Who&#39;s crying?&quot;]] or [[&quot;Are you alright in there?&quot;]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="&quot;I got through a portal.&quot;" tags="" position="632,747" size="100,100">&quot;I got through a portal,&quot; you said. The troll tilted its head.
&quot;A portal?&quot; the troll recalled, &quot;There wasn&#39;t one in years.&quot; You suddenly got surprised at that response.
&quot;Look human,&quot; the troll said, &quot;You can&#39;t be here. You&#39;ll either get out or I&#39;ll make you.&quot; He suddenly put his fists up.
You hesitate. The troll is really going to fight you. This isn&#39;t fair. You&#39;ve only been here for a short time. There looks to be much to explore, and that troll isn&#39;t going to ruin it. You will either [[run away]], or [[fight]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="33" name="&quot;My mirror in my room transported me here.&quot;" tags="" position="540,762" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="34" name="run away" tags="" position="474,871" size="100,100">You decided to run away.

&quot;Coward!&quot; the troll shouted from behind.
You ran back and headed straight to the [[Right Path]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="35" name="fight" tags="" position="357,873" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="36" name="&quot;Who&#39;s crying?&quot;" tags="" position="1105,783" size="100,100">You said, &quot;Who&#39;s crying?&quot;
The crying stopped. &quot;Who&#39;s out there?&quot; the lady said.
&quot;My name is [your name],&quot; you said.
&quot;Oh,&quot; the lady said, &quot;The door is open. You can come in.&quot;
You opened the door and walked inside. You saw that the lady was a troll, with yellow fur, a pink dress, and red shoes. She was in the kitchen, sitting on a wooden chair, crying.
You went over to her and bended down to reach her level.
You said, [[&quot;Are you okay?&quot;]] or [[&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="37" name="&quot;Are you alright in there?&quot;" tags="" position="1227,804" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="38" name="&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;" tags="" position="1350,854" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="39" name="&quot;Are you okay?&quot;" tags="" position="1383,715" size="100,100">You said, &quot;Are you okay?&quot; The female troll looked up.
&quot;Y-You&#39;re not a troll,&quot; she said, &quot;You&#39;re a human.&quot;
[[You nodded]] or [[&quot;Is that a problem?&quot;]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="40" name="You nodded" tags="" position="1203,973" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="41" name="&quot;Is that a problem?&quot;" tags="" position="937,1101" size="100,100">&quot;Is that a problem?&quot; you asked. The lady flinched.
&quot;No, not at all!&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;But my husband thinks it is?&quot;
&quot;Since humans have been coming here, my husband grew very angry about it. He wanted to get them out, but I told him to stay put and let the head chief do something. Now that another human has come, presumably you, my husband was out of control and went out to find you.&quot; She started crying again.
How does she know? You [[asked the question]] or [[didn&#39;t say anything]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="42" name="asked the question" tags="" position="819,1083" size="100,100">You asked the question. The lady looked up.
&quot;We trolls automatically know when something is...off,&quot; she said, shaking her head. You didn&#39;t see anything off about the world.
&quot;I wish my husband was here,&quot; she said, &quot;Have you seen him?&quot;
You [[didn&#39;t see him]] or [[recalled the troll who wanted to fight you]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="43" name="didn&#39;t say anything" tags="" position="682,1063" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="44" name="didn&#39;t see him" tags="" position="1048,966" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="45" name="recalled the troll who wanted to fight you" tags="" position="567,1020" size="100,100">You recalled the troll who wanted to fight you, wearing the overalls and brown loafers. You told her about him.
&quot;Oh!&quot; the lady exclaimed, &quot;Was he on the left path or the right path?&quot;
You thought about it and then said [[right path]] or [[left path]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="46" name="left path" tags="" position="577,1152" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="47" name="right path" tags="" position="443,1176" size="100,100">You said the right path.

&quot;No,&quot; she said, &quot;He mentioned that he was going to the left path. Why are you lying?&quot; She cried again.
*Be careful not to make the wrong choices, or bad things will happen. Now you have to cheer up the lady.*
You patted her on the back. You said, [[&quot;Everything will be okay.&quot;]] or [[&quot;Do you two have any children?&quot;]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="48" name="&quot;Everything will be okay.&quot;" tags="" position="333,1093" size="100,100">You said, &quot;Everything will be okay.&quot; She looked up.
&quot;Really? Well, if you say so.&quot;
She got up from her chair and faced you. She is really short and looked cute in the dress. She had big blue eyes.
&quot;Now that I&#39;ve stopped crying, allow me to introduce myself. I am Maria, a resident of this world. May I ask, how did you get into this world?&quot;
You said, [[&quot;I walked through a portal.&quot;]] or [[&quot;My magic mirror brought me here.&quot;]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="49" name="&quot;Do you two have any children?&quot;" tags="" position="446,1030" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="50" name="&quot;I walked through a portal.&quot;" tags="" position="223,1077" size="100,100">&quot;I walked through a portal,&quot; you said.
&quot;A portal. Where was this portal?&quot; Maria asked.
You told her that it was in the middle of a field of flowers.
&quot;Ah-hah!&quot; Maria exclaimed, &quot;So that was where these humans were coming from. You just found this portal?&quot;
You [[nodded]] or said, [[&quot;Yup!&quot;]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="51" name="&quot;My magic mirror brought me here.&quot;" tags="" position="213,1207" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="52" name="&quot;Yup!&quot;" tags="" position="62,959" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="53" name="nodded" tags="" position="196,931" size="100,100">You nodded.

&quot;Interesting,&quot; she said, &quot;I must report this. But first, we need to find my husband.&quot;
You had a confused expression on your face. Maria noticed it.
&quot;I see you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on here,&quot; Maria said, &quot;I&#39;m sure the head chief can explain, but first, we need to find my husband.&quot;
She grabs your hand and leads you to the door.
As you two are walking, you thought to yourself. There are people before you? How did they get here? Where are they now? Were they ever able to get out? You wanted to ask these to Maria, but she shouted.
&quot;There he is!&quot; she said as she pointed to the troll who was coming from the right path.
You looked at the troll&#39;s [[familiar]] or [[unfamiliar]] face.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="54" name="familiar" tags="" position="247,790" size="100,100">You looked at the troll&#39;s familar face.

&quot;I&#39;ve seen you before!&quot; he shouted,&quot; Maria, how can you be with this human.&quot;
&quot;This human came to my house,&quot; Maria explained,&quot; He cheered me up and encouraged me to do something about you.&quot;
&quot;What?&quot; the troll yelled, &quot;Did you do something to my wife? And get your hands off her!&quot;
He charged toward you and slapped your hand away from Maria.
&quot;Charles!&quot; Maria shouted. Charles? you thought.
&quot;This will be a perfect time to fight,&quot; Charles said as he got into a fighting position.

After your last hit, he stumbles back and falls on his butt. His head is swaying around. He looks dazed. He&#39;s probably had enough.
*You win! You gained 50 XP and you are now level 2. Your health is now 100. When you eat food, your health will go up, so be on the lookout for any food for now on*
Now that you are done with your fight, you feel a fresh feeling filling your body. You feel good.
You look to Charles, then back to Maria, who was terribly frightened.
Which person should you go to? [[Charles]] or [[Maria]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="74" name="Kick Once More" tags="" position="321,652" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="75" name="Charles" tags="" position="499,541" size="100,100">You go to Charles. He is currently in a dazed state right now. There are imaginary objects flying around his head.
You tap him. He snaps out of it and looks up.
&quot;Ouch,&quot; he said.
&quot;Charles!&quot; Maria shouted as she went over to her husband. You step back for Maria to be next to him. You quickly apologize and said that it had to be done.
&quot;Charles?&quot; Maria called to her husband. Charles looks at you.
&quot;I was wrong about you,&quot; he said and he scratched his head, &quot;You really do have fighting skills. You suddenly recall the tae kwon do lessons you had as a child. Who knew it could lead up to this?
Maria helped him up to his feet. His body is currently beaten from the fight. You felt guilt rise up and came to his aid. Charles looks at his wife.
&quot;Come on, Maria,&quot; he said, &quot;Take me home and whip up this winner something to eat.&quot; Maria nodded and the two of you lead Charles back to the house.
Maria opened the door and sat her husband on one of the wooden chairs near the dinner table in the kitchen.
&quot;I&#39;ll give you a medical kit in a minute,&quot; Maria said to her husband and looks at you, &quot;What would you like to eat? [[Apple Pie]] or [[Peach Cobbler]]?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="76" name="Maria" tags="" position="351,435" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="77" name="Apple Pie" tags="" position="759,659" size="100,100">You said &#39;Apple Pie&#39;. That was your favorite dessert and used to eat as a child. You want to experience those memories by eat some right now.
Maria heard your answer and went in further to the kitchen to make the dessert. While she was doing that, you are now standing where Charles is sitting. He looks at you.
&quot;So human,&quot; he said, &quot;You like apple pie?&quot; You answered yes.
&quot;Well, that&#39;s my wife&#39;s favorite dessert.&quot; You grew surprised by that. Charles chuckled.
&quot;Every time we have dinner, my wife insists that we have apple pie for dessert, but I say peach cobbler, and in the end, both of them won.&quot;
Maria gave Charles a medical kit after a minute. Maria insisted on applying the supplies, but Charles told her that he&#39;ll do it himself. Maria understood and went on to still making the apple pie. Meanwhile, you and the wounded Charles chat. It seems that his wounds are healing as he applys ointment and bandages at the place where you hit him. The guilt was coming back as you watch him.
Do you want to [[help him]] or [[not]]?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="78" name="Peach Cobbler" tags="" position="616,628" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="79" name="help him" tags="" position="852,799" size="100,100">You decided to help him since you caused those wounds.
You walk over to him and insisted on helping him apply bandages. Charles looks at you for a minute. After that, he agrees with a nod.
While you were applying bandages, Charles apologizes.
&quot;Sorry for starting a fight with you. I know my wife doesn&#39;t like when I do that, but it was too late for me to remember that.&quot; You apologize too.
&quot;So... how did you get here again?&quot; You answered his question.
&quot;Oh yeah, but how?&quot; You couldn&#39;t answer his question, instead, you applied more bandages.
&quot;There wasn&#39;t one in years,&quot; Charles said, &quot;How can a portal mysteriously appear in our world? Which world have you came from?&quot; You thought about that for a moment.
[[&quot;World of the human race&quot;]] or [[&quot;World 2 of the screaming pineapples&quot;]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="80" name="not" tags="" position="742,783" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="81" name="&quot;World 2 of the screaming pineapples&quot;" tags="" position="981,844" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="82" name="&quot;World of the human race&quot;" tags="" position="888,968" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
